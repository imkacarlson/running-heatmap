# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current mobile testing infrastructure for the running heatmap application takes longer than desired to execute when running `./test.sh`. The test suite requires significant time to complete due to expensive build operations, emulator startup, data processing, and sequential test execution. This impacts development productivity and CI/CD pipeline efficiency.

This feature aims to optimize test execution time while maintaining full emulator testing coverage and preserving all existing test functionality. The goal is to improve performance as much as feasibly possible through intelligent caching, automation, and efficiency improvements.

## Alignment with Product Vision

Faster test execution directly supports development velocity and quality assurance by:
- Enabling more rapid iteration cycles during feature development
- Reducing CI/CD pipeline bottlenecks
- Maintaining high test coverage with improved feedback times
- Supporting test-driven development practices

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test execution to be as fast as feasibly possible, so that I can get rapid feedback during development cycles

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `./test.sh` THEN the complete test suite SHALL complete significantly faster than current baseline
2. WHEN tests are run consecutively THEN subsequent runs SHALL be faster due to cached artifacts
3. WHEN I run `./test.sh --fast` THEN tests SHALL complete quickly using cached artifacts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve full emulator testing capabilities, so that test coverage and accuracy remain unchanged

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are optimized THEN all existing test functionality SHALL remain intact
2. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL still use full Android emulator (not mocked)
3. WHEN tests execute THEN all current test assertions and validations SHALL pass unchanged
4. WHEN tests complete THEN test coverage SHALL not be reduced

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent build caching with automatic change detection, so that expensive operations only run when necessary

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN source code files haven't changed THEN APK building SHALL be automatically skipped using cached artifacts
2. WHEN test data files haven't changed THEN PMTiles generation SHALL be automatically skipped using cached data
3. WHEN emulator is already running THEN emulator startup SHALL be skipped
4. IF cached artifacts are invalid or missing THEN the system SHALL regenerate them automatically
5. WHEN determining if rebuilds are needed THEN the system SHALL use file modification timestamps and checksums for accurate detection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want parallel test execution where safe, so that test suite runtime is minimized

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple independent tests exist THEN they SHALL run in parallel when safe
2. WHEN tests have shared dependencies THEN they SHALL run sequentially to avoid conflicts
3. WHEN parallel execution fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to sequential execution with clear error reporting

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an optional persistent infrastructure mode, so that I can choose between isolated runs or persistent services for multiple test cycles

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `./test.sh` THEN it SHALL work as it currently does with full cleanup
2. WHEN I want persistent infrastructure THEN I SHALL have access to a separate script (e.g., `persist_tests.sh`) that keeps services running
3. WHEN using persistent mode THEN I SHALL be able to run `./test.sh` multiple times against the persistent infrastructure
4. WHEN I'm done with persistent mode THEN I SHALL have a clear way to trigger full cleanup
5. IF persistent services become unresponsive THEN they SHALL be automatically restarted
6. WHEN implementing this THEN cleanup code SHALL be modularized and reused, not duplicated

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic detection of data changes, so that only necessary data processing occurs

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GPX files haven't changed THEN data processing SHALL be automatically skipped
2. WHEN PMTiles exist and are up-to-date THEN regeneration SHALL be automatically skipped  
3. WHEN test data is modified THEN only affected data SHALL be reprocessed
4. WHEN data integrity is compromised THEN full reprocessing SHALL occur automatically
5. WHEN determining if data processing is needed THEN the system SHALL use file modification timestamps for accurate detection

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement intelligent caching for build artifacts, test data, and processed assets
- **Automatic Change Detection**: Create smart dependency tracking using file timestamps and checksums
- **Service Management**: Design optional persistent service architecture for emulator and Appium management
- **Parallel Execution**: Implement safe parallelization with conflict detection and resolution
- **Code Reuse**: Modularize cleanup and service management code to avoid duplication

### Performance
- **Optimization Goal**: Maximize test execution speed improvements through all feasible optimizations
- **Build Optimization**: APK builds only when source code changes detected automatically
- **Data Processing**: Automatic incremental processing for GPX and PMTiles generation
- **Resource Utilization**: Efficient CPU and memory usage during parallel execution

### Reliability
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Sequential execution fallback if parallel execution fails
- **Cache Validation**: Automatic cache invalidation when corruption or staleness detected
- **Service Health Monitoring**: Health checks for persistent services with auto-recovery
- **Atomic Operations**: Ensure cache operations are atomic to prevent corruption

### Maintainability
- **Configuration**: Centralized configuration for timeouts, parallelization limits, and cache policies
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for cache hits/misses, execution paths, and performance metrics
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintain existing test command interface while adding optimization features
- **Clear Error Messages**: Detailed error reporting when optimization features fail
- **Dual Mode Support**: Support both traditional isolated runs and optional persistent infrastructure

# Product Steering

## Vision & Mission

**Vision**: Transform personal GPS activity data into an accessible, privacy-focused mobile visualization tool that helps runners understand their training patterns and explore their activity history.

**Mission**: Create an offline-first Android app that processes GPS files from fitness platforms (Strava, Garmin Connect) into an interactive heatmap, enabling runners to visualize their complete activity history without compromising privacy or requiring internet connectivity.

**Problem Solved**: Runners and fitness enthusiasts want to visualize their complete activity history across all platforms in a unified view, but existing solutions require cloud connectivity, compromise privacy, or lack comprehensive multi-source data integration.

**Target Users**:
- **Primary**: Privacy-conscious runners who track activities across multiple platforms (Strava, Garmin, etc.)
- **Secondary**: Fitness enthusiasts interested in spatial analysis of their training patterns
- **Tertiary**: Athletes preparing for events in specific geographic areas who want to analyze training coverage

## User Experience Principles

### Core UX Guidelines
- **Mobile-First Design**: All interactions optimized for touch devices and single-handed operation
- **Offline-First Experience**: Full functionality without internet connectivity after initial setup
- **Privacy by Design**: All data processing and storage happens locally on device
- **Immediate Value**: Users see their complete activity history within minutes of data import

### Design System Principles
- **Minimalist Interface**: Clean, map-focused design with contextual controls
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features (lasso selection, filtering) revealed when needed
- **Gesture-Driven Navigation**: Standard mobile map interactions (pan, zoom, pinch)
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Activity heatmap as primary focus, controls as secondary elements

### Accessibility Requirements
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44dp touch targets for all interactive elements
- **Contrast Standards**: WCAG AA compliant color schemes for map overlays and UI elements
- **Device Compatibility**: Support for Android 7+ devices with varying screen sizes
- **Performance Standards**: Smooth interaction with datasets up to 10,000+ activities

### Performance Standards
- **App Launch Time**: Under 3 seconds on mid-range devices
- **Map Rendering**: Smooth 60fps scrolling and zooming with large datasets
- **Query Response**: Lasso selection results within 500ms for typical queries
- **Memory Efficiency**: Stable operation with <200MB RAM usage
